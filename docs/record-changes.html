directory can be in one of two states: <em>tracked</em> or <em>untracked</em>.<!-- --> <!-- -->Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot, as well as any newly staged files; they can be

in your last snapshot and are not in your staging area.<!-- --> <!-- -->When you first clone a repository, all of your files will be tracked and unmodified because Git just checked them out and you haven&#x27;t edited anything.</p><p>As you edit files, Git sees them as modified, because you&#x27;ve changed them since your last commit.<!-- --> <!-- -->As you work, you selectively stage these modified files and then commit all those staged changes, and the cycle repeats.</p><p><img src="/images/lifecycle.svg" alt="The lifecycle of the status of your files"/></p><h2

</code></pre><p>and it works fine.<!-- --> <!-- -->In fact, if you run something like this and look at the status, you&#x27;ll see that Git considers it a renamed file:</p><pre class="prism-code language-undefined"><code><span class="token plain">$ git mv README.md README</span>
<span class="token plain">$ git status</span>

<span class="token plain">$ git rm README.md</span>
<span class="token plain">$ git add README</span>
</code></pre><p>Git figures out that it&#x27;s a rename implicitly, so it doesn&#x27;t matter if you rename a file that way or with the <code>mv</code> command.<!-- --> <!-- -->The only real difference is that <code>git mv</code> is one command instead of three -- it&#x27;s a convenience function.<!-- --> <!-- -->More importantly, you can use any tool you like to rename a file, and
